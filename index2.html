      <p>In my opinion, streaming has a high demand. It is due to many people having gadgets and internet connection. Streaming is also a part of my life. I watch educational videos to learn something from it. I also watch gaming videos because I enjoy it. And I listen to music because I enjoy it too. Streaming has been a part of people's lives, especially when they can access the internet. That's why streaming is important.<br><br>

      <p>For me it is important because streaming can be also a small livelihood not just for entertainment. Thanks to sponsors, streamers can promote the brand as a exchange for money while doing contents. So streaming is helpful to people, you can earn money and entertain people.<br><br>- Juriel</p><br><br>
      <p>Streaming media is better than downloading.<br><br>- Jessie</p>
