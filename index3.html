      <br>
      <p>Here is our journey on how we found the need in streaming.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>We are a group of students and we are assigned to tell the audience our journey in finding the need of streaming in this website. In order to do that, we must learn more about streaming. To do that, we did a research about streaming and its audience. We found out many things about streaming, including how much people are streaming media content and what is the mos streamed content. And now we will share it to you.<br><br>Due to the pandemic that we are experiencing, the number of people streaming media on the internet skyrocketed. Many people stream media now because we are obliged to stay at home.  As more people are forced to stay at home to try to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, the concept of a bored, cable-cutting consumer searching for things to constantly watch for weeks on end has become a reality. </p><center>

<p>As you read this sentence, many people are streaming media, whether it's video, music, or live-streaming. Millions of people go online for entertainment and more, and that includes streaming media online. Some people stream because they enjoy the content. Some people want to learn new things from a specific video that's why they watch it. And some people listen to music to relax, or simply just enjoy listening to music.<br><br>There are many types of applications or websites where you can stream content. You can use Youtube to stream videos or even livestream videos. Same goes with Facebook. In Spotify, you can stream music and podcasts. You can also watch movies in Netflix. And there's still more, there are hudreds of apps where you can stream media.<br><br>
<p>Well, that's a brief introduction to what streaming is and how many people use it. The real question is, do they really need to stream media content. There is no specific answer to that. Streaming isn't necessarily needed, but it can help people. It helps people to ease their boredom. It helps people for their research and other educational purposes. It helps people to relax. And there's more to that. Plus, it helps some people earn money. They can use streaming for business.</p><br><br>

<center><p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/249396/top-youtube-videos-views/">statista.com</a>, music videos are the most streamed type of videos in Youtube. I and my friends also stream music videos there. Here is an example of a music video in Youtube. (I can't embed a real music video so here's super idol instead.)</p><br><br></center>

<center><p>Speaking of music, there's also Spotify. You can play music on Spotify online. I personally use Spotify too. Here is an example of music in Spotify. Just press the play button and you're good to go.</p></center><br><br>
